# Timely vaccination and strengthening of genomic surveillance curbed consecutive waves of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern

Characterization of the phylodynamics of SARS-CoV-2 variants in Uruguay from March, 2020 to September, 2021 and the association with the epidemiologycal scenario (e.g number of cases, fatalities and vaccination coverage) in the country. 

### Data analysis
All uruguayan sequences genertated in this study are availiable in [GISAID](https://gisaid.org/).  
Variant characterization of the samples processed using a qPCR assay (vPCR) can be found [here](https://github.com/Ceci07/SARS-CoV-2_URU/blob/main/docs/vPCR.pdf).  
Lineage and Nextstrain clade characterization of Uruguay new sequences can be found [here](https://github.com/Ceci07/SARS-CoV-2_URU/blob/main/docs/samp_class2.pdf).  
Commands for phylogenetics & phylodynamic analysis can be found [here](https://github.com/Ceci07/SARS-CoV-2_URU/blob/main/docs/index.pdf).  
The analysis of the Delta VOC introduction into Uruguay and the transition rates from/to Uruguay can be found [here](https://github.com/Ceci07/SARS-CoV-2_URU/blob/main/docs/intros_orig.pdf).  
The geograhycal dynamics of the Delta and Gamma in Uruguay can be found [here](https://github.com/Ceci07/SARS-CoV-2_URU/blob/main/docs/subtrees.pdf).
